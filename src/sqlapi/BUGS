- sqlite interface doesn't work well with dburl
- pooling with sqlite doesn't work
- This one is a bad one... when using a table object instance
  to return a query result (which is actualy a generator), if
  you call the same query twice, it updates globally, which means
  that once you've not consumed your former generator, its contents
  will be updated. The workaround for now is to turn it into a list
  once you retrieve
