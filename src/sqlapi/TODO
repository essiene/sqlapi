- Currently we only return iterators, have versions that return actual lists or in the case of single
  values... just the values themselves.

- name-refactor the decorators @columns and @nocolumns, still don't feel right yet.

- It would be fantastically ecstaticous to have a functions like this:

@dynaquery
def insertfoo(self):
    '''insert into foo(a,b,c) values(%s,%s,%s)'''

and be able to call insertfoo like so:

insertfoo(a,b,c)

Basically, generating a function that can anticipate what its parameter list would 
actually be.

            - Stan is crazy... he suggested this!!!

- query string sanitization and quoting is not done.
